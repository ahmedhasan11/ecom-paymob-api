1- in normal , you make a class Car and when you need to use its method you make a new obj of this class and use the 
				method useing this obj         --------> You who made the Class

2- what if you are not the Owner of the class ,,,,, "you are not the one who made it"

3-here we want to add a method to this class and use it as its a part of this class  [Extension Method meaning]
		دي ميثود برّه الكلاس
		لكن C# يخليك تستخدمها كأنها جواه


public static class MyExtensions
{
    public static void MyMethod(this SomeType obj)
    {
"SomeType" --> this means that this Extension Method can be used as a method inside this SomeType Class
ex: SomeType= "String" ---> so if you made a obj of String class , you will see the Extension Method


public static IServiceCollection AddInfrastructure(
    this IServiceCollection services,IConfiguration configuration)

here--> any obj of type IServiceCollection can call AddInfrastructure
